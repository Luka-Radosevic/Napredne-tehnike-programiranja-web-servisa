            <p>Timothy John Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist who invented the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p>He was born on 8 June 1955 in London, and went on to study physics at Oxford University before becoming a software engineer.</p>
            <p>In 1980, while working at CERN (the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva), he first described the concept of a global system based on 'hypertext' that would allow researchers to share information globally. He also built a prototype called 'Enquire'.</p>
            <p>In 1984, Berners-Lee returned to CERN, which was also home to a major European Internet node. In 1989, he published a paper titled 'Information Management: A Proposal', where he combined hypertext with the Internet to create a global system for sharing information. This was the birth of the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p>He also created the first web browser and editor. The first website, <a href="http://info.cern.ch" target="_blank">http://info.cern.ch</a>, was launched on 6 August 1991 to introduce the concept of the World Wide Web and help users start creating their own websites.</p>
            <p>In 1994, Berners-Lee founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Laboratory of Computer Science (LCS) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Boston. He has served as the director of W3C ever since. He also works as a senior research scientist at LCS, which has now become the Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).</p>
