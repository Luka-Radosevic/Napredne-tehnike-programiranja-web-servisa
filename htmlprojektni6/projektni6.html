            <p>Timothy Berners-Lee is a British computer scientist who invented the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p>Born on June 8, 1955, in London, Berners-Lee studied physics at Oxford University before becoming a software engineer.</p>
            <p>In 1980, while working at CERN (the European Particle Physics Laboratory in Geneva), he first proposed the concept of a global system based on hypertext that would allow researchers to share information across the globe. He also developed a prototype named 'Enquire'.</p>
            <p>In 1984, he returned to CERN, which was a major European Internet hub at the time. In 1989, he published a paper titled "Information Management: A Proposal", which combined hypertext with the Internet, creating a system for global information sharingâ€”this system would eventually be known as the World Wide Web.</p>
            <p>Berners-Lee created the first web browser and editor. The first website, <a href="http://info.cern.ch" target="_blank">http://info.cern.ch</a>, was launched on 6 August 1991, introducing users to the World Wide Web and providing an introduction to creating websites.</p>
            <p>In 1994, he founded the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and has served as its director since then. He also continues to work as a senior research scientist at MIT's Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory (CSAIL).</p>
